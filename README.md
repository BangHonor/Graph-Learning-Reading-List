# Graph Learning Reading List

I scanned over the accepted paper lists of top machine learning and data mining conferences for interests in graph learning. If you are interested in dynamic (temporal) graph learning, please refer to [Dynamic (Temporal) Graph Learning Reading List](https://github.com/doujiang-zheng/Dynamic-Temporal-Graph-Learning-Reading-List).
